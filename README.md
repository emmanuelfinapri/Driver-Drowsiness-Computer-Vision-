# Driver Drowsiness Detection

Driver Drowsiness Detection is a real-time project built using **Dlib** and **OpenCV** with **Python** as the backend. It detects whether a driver is **active**, **drowsy**, or **sleepy** using facial landmarks and eye aspect ratio analysis.

## ðŸ”§ How it Works

- The project uses **Dlibâ€™s 68 facial landmark detector** and its face detection algorithm.
- A specific calculation based on the **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)** is used:
  
  > EAR = (Vertical Eye Distances) / (Horizontal Eye Distance)

- Based on this EAR value, thresholds are set to detect:
  - **Active**: Eyes open
  - **Drowsy**: Eyes partially closed
